# Richmond-VA-Top-40-Restaurants

Hello! I'll be moving from Southern California to Richmond, Virginia and in an effort to better understand the culture of the city and it's highly popular food scene, I've decided to perform an exploratory data analysis of the top search results on Yelp. 

This project is composed of three parts: 
  1. Data collection through webscraping Yelp (using Python, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas)
  2. Data cleaning & wrangling (using NumPy and Pandas)
  3. Exploratory analysis and visualization (using Pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn)

As I better understand Richmond's food scene (as well as my own programming capabilities) I'm excited for you to join me on this little project! Moving forward, I will continue to add further analysis to this repository. I hope to soon add Part 4 - where I will use NTLK and Natural Language Processing principles in Python to perform a sentiment analysis of one of my favorite restaurants.
