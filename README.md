# Richmond-VA-Top-40-Restaurants

Hi all! I'll be moving from Southern California to Richmond, Virginia for a new job and to be with my partner as she begins medical school. In an effort to better understand the culture of the city and it's highly popular food scene, I decided to perform an exploratory data analysis of the top search results on Yelp. 

This project is composed of three parts: data collection via web scraping Yelp; data cleaning & wrangling; exploratory analysis and visualization. As I better understand Richmond's food scene (as well as my own programming capabilities) I'm excited for you to join me on this little project.
